# Projects  

[**IntelliTrainer – AI-Powered Exercise Tracker**](https://github.com/ai-ml-club-sjsu/project-fa25-intellitrainer)  
Developed under the **AI and ML at SJSU** organization. The official project page is hosted at  
[https://www.ai-ml-club-sjsu.com](https://www.ai-ml-club-sjsu.com/projects)  
but is currently private due to organizational ownership.  

Pose-driven fitness assistant focused on **per-exercise form evaluation** rather than generic activity classification.  
- Re-architected the pipeline after mid-semester testing, removing unnecessary exercise detection in favor of **targeted, rule-based analysis** for each movement.  
- Improved joint tracking stability, angle consistency, and repetition detection through refined **MediaPipe processing** and cleaner state-based logic.  
- Designed for modular growth, with planned support for **LLM-based coaching**, user progress modeling, and **GPU-accelerated inference**.  


[**Predictive Analytics for Safer Roads**](https://github.com/knaythan/traffic-analysis)  
Traffic accident severity prediction system using **PyTorch, Plotly Dash, and Google BigQuery**.  
- Built neural network and statistical models on a dataset of **7.7 million traffic accidents**.  
- Developed an interactive analytics dashboard deployed on **Google App Engine**.  
- Performed advanced feature engineering and statistical testing using weather, road, and environmental data.  


[**Club Hub – University Club Management Platform**](https://github.com/Daoranger/Club-Hub)  
Full-stack web application for managing university student organizations using **React, Node.js, MySQL, and Express**.  
- Implemented user authentication, event tracking, and organization workflows.  
- Designed a scalable backend architecture paired with a responsive, interactive UI.

## Future Plans and Research Interests

Expanding into **large-scale AI systems, multimodal machine learning, and applied research**, with a focus on building tools that meaningfully improve real-world workflows.

- ML Lead for the **IntelliTrainer** project under AI and ML at SJSU, developing an intelligent exercise tracking platform combining **rule-based systems, ML pipelines, GPU acceleration**, and future **LLM-based coaching**.  
- Increasing participation in university and national **hackathons** to rapidly prototype ideas and explore emerging technologies in competitive environments.  
- Studying advanced concepts in **AI agents and autonomous workflows**, including planning, tool use, long-context reasoning, and memory-based agent architectures.  
- Building an **AI agent system** to automate core aspects of college life such as class scheduling, assignment tracking, email drafting, study planning, and productivity analysis.
